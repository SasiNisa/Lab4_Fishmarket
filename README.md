# Lab4_Fishmarket
In this project I have built a model for predicting Species type from the features Weight, Length, Width and height of the species.
I have used jupyter notebook for building the model.
I have developed a flask application for taking user interface.
Creating a Virtual environment i installed all the dependencies through requirements.txt
The flask application has been pushed to my GitHub Repository.
From GitHub I have deployed the model in render. The link for the project in render is
